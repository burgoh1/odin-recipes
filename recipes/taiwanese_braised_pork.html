    <p>
        Taiwanese braised pork has got to be one of the best dishes man kind has ever made period. The sweet and savory flavors 
        you get from slow cooking the pork is unbeatable. I was born and raised in Manila, Phillipines so you know us filipinos have some 
        really good food.

        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>3 tbsp light soy sause</li>
        <li>2 tbsp dark soy sause</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>4 hard boiled eggs</li>
        <li>3 star anise</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>6 cloves</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 tsp sichuan peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 slices fresh ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (just enough 
            so that the pork will be fully submerged), and blanch 
            the chopped pork belly for 1 minute. Drain, rinse 
            clean of any scum, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wok over low heat, and add the sugar. 
            Cook the sugar until it starts to melt and then add the 
            onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry 
            the onions for a minute. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry 
            for another couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the blanched pork, shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, 
            dark soy sauce and water. Stir and bring the mixture to 
            a boil. Once boiling, add the spices (which should be 
            tied in cheese cloth), along with the peeled hardboiled 
            eggs and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 
            1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>At this point the meat should be fall-apart tender. 
            To finish the dish, remove the spice packet and turn up 
            the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce, stirring 
            occasionally. This process should take about 5-minutes. 
            The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, but 
            there should still be plenty of it left. Serve over 
            steame</li>
    </ol>
