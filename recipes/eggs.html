        with salted chilies at least 
        2 times a week if Im on my own. Ill eat it any time of 
        day—breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tbps neutral oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cups chinese garlic chives</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hunan salted chilies</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, add the eggs, sesame oil, and white pepper. 
            Beat with chopsticks, a fork, or small whisk for about 1 minute, 
            or until you see some frothy bubbles on the surface of the egg. 
            Mix the cornstarch into a slurry with 1 tablespoon of water, and 
            beat into the eggs.</li>
        <li>Heat a wok over high heat, or a nonstick skillet over medium-high 
            heat. When its really hot, add the oil, followed by the garlic 
            chives. Cook until theyre wilted but still bright green (you dont 
            want them to brown at all). Add the duo jiao salted chilies, taking 
            care not to scoop the liquid with the peppers, which will make your 
            eggs fry up less evenly. If youre using regular chives, which are 
            more delicate, reverse the order and add the duo jiao to the wok 
            before the chives to avoid burning them.</li>
        <li>When the wok is steaming again (i.e., really hot), pour in the eggs. 
            They should immediately bubble at the edges. Stir with a wok spatula 
            (or rubber spatula, if using a nonstick skillet) using wide scooping 
            motions to fold the eggs towards the center, swirling any uncooked 
            egg back onto the hot surface of the wok. Theres no need to be 
            strictly uniform—just make sure youre using big strokes to make 
            fluffy large chunks and constantly moving the eggs to avoid 
            overcooking them.</li>
        <li>When the egg is just set (i.e., there may still be small pockets of 
            runny bits), turn off the heat and plate immediately. The eggs will 
            cook in their residual heat on the way to the dinner table. </li>
    </ol>
