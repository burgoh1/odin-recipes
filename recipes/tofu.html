    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sause</li>
        <li>1 tbsp spicy bean paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp scallions</li>
        <li>1 lb silken tofu</li>
        <li>1-2 century egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the soy sauce, bean paste, sesame oil, and sugar in a small bowl. 
            Add half the garlic and half the scallions. Mix it all together.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the silken tofu from the package. First, slice the 
            plastic around the block of tofu, and then use a paring knife to 
            separate the tofu from the sides of the box. Then turn it over onto 
            the serving bowl. Slice the tofu crosswise into 1/2 inch (1.2cm) 
            thick slices. If using, arrange the pieces of century egg around the 
            tofu.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the sauce over the tofu, and garnish with the rest of the 
            garlic and scallion on top. You can also garnish with a bit of chopped 
            cilantro and/or Thai basil. Stir everything together at the table, 
            and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
